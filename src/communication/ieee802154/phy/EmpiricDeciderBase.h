/**
 * Abstract class. Serves as a basis for empirical deciders.
 * A derived empirical Decider has to implement the
 * getEmpiricAttenuationMapping(AirFrame* frame), providing an attenuation
 * mapping for the signal of the given air frame. E.g. to set the received
 * signal power to a certain level, one could simply divide the target mapping
 * by the current signal power mapping and return the result as attenuation
 * mapping.
 *
 * As the attenuation mapping is added to the signal within the
 * processSignal(Airframe* frame) method, this method MUST NOT be
 * overridden by a deriving class.
