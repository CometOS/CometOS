 * Base class for communication layer. DataRequest and DataIndication

 * +--------+------+------+--------+-----+
 * | params | name | type | module | seq |
 * +--------+------+------+--------+-----+
 * |  var   |  var |   1  |   var  |  1  |
 * +--------+------+------+--------+-----+
 *
 * seq     is the sequence number of the message
 * module  is an AirString containing the module name after a 1 byte len field
 * type    is the type of the remote command (see enum)
 * name    AirString with a 1 byte length field and the name of the
 *         variable/event/method to read/subscribe/call
 *
 *
 * Response format is
 * +--------+--------+------+
 * |  ret   | status |  seq |
 * +--------+--------+------+
 * |  var   |    1   |   1  |
 * +--------+--------+------+
 *
 * ret    Return value, variable depending on method/var/event type
 * status Status code
