 * The rfxlink stack is primarily intended to be run using tasklets with
 * interrupts on.  Tasklets provide for reasonable mutual exclusion (like
 * tasks with run to completion) while having the response latency from
 * running at interrupt level.
 *
 * RadioAlarm want to have interrupts reenabled.  This is done in Alarm.fired
 * which is the handler that initially gets notified when a timer interrupt
 * has fired.
