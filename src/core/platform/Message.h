     * to be a pointer to void in the past. However, this is NOT SAFE in
     * presence of multiple inheritance, when the most derived class was the
     * actual type T for the method but a pointer to Module was
     * passed to the schedule method (@see Module::schedule). Explanation:
     *
     * Base1  Module            +------------------+ <-- DerivedModule, Base1
     *   |     |                | vptr Base1       |
     *   |     |                +------------------+ <-- Module
     *    \   /                 | vptr Module      |
     *     \ /                  | ModuleMember1    |
     * DerivedModule            |     ...          |
     *                          | ModuleMembern    |
     *                          |     ...          |
     *                          +------------------+
     *
     * With an inheritance hierarchy as shown on the left, the actual
     * arrangement of a DerivedModule object in memory looks something like
     * the picture on the right. Module::schedule now passes the this pointer
     * of Module, containing the offset to the Delegate constructor. This
     * pointer is then stored and later casted back to DerivedModule type
     * by means of the template parameters (instantiation in
     * UnboundedDelegate::set()).
     * (@see UnboundedDelegate::Delegate_stub_t::method_stub). In case we
     * downcast a Module pointer to a DerivedModule pointer, the compiler will
     * know about the offset it has to apply to the actual address and
     * everything is fine. However, if the Module pointer is converted to void*
     * in the meantime, there are no means to know about the necessary offset
     * and the cast will pointer will wrongly point to a wrong address.
     * This results in a wrong this pointer when the actual method call is
     * executed and is a sure recipe for disaster.
