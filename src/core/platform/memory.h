 *
 * Optionally you can use the following switches:
 *
 * #define MEMORY_THREAD_SAFE	      -  memory operations are atomic
 *
 * #define MEMORY_NO_EXHAUSTION_CHECK - no assert in case of an exhausted
 * 										memory (NULL is returned)
 *
 * The following implementations for the memory allocation exist:
 *
 * <li> BlockAllocator: paging algorithm
 * <li> SurmAllocator: multiple pool allocation (dynamic pool management)
 *
 * Currently it is recommend to use the SurmAllocator.
